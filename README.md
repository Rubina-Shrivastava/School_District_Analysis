# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
    The purpose of our analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students and their performance according to schools, then we have found that some of the test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School are missing.  we want to replace this with NaN, and after that, we do our analysis with this new change to take all of the scores from the high school so that it doesn't affect our overall numbers.
  
## Results

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

    Overall, it does not affect either the reading scores or math scores. We are doing this only for Thomas school (9th graders); and it is not having any significant impact.

#### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: #Math and reading scores by grade

    The only difference now between the scores is that under 9th graders who attended Thomas High School it shows a NaN.

### Scores by school spending

    The numbers stay nearly identical since the 9th graders scores only for one school are changed with NaN.

### Scores by school size

### Scores by school type

    Scores by school type do not change.
